    "**1.  What is the question you will be working on? Why is it interesting?** <br>\n",
    "The question we will be working on is identifying what traits make a song stay on top 200 charts the longest?  Given a set of known features about a song, can we predict if it will land on the top 200 and if so for how long?  This question is interesting because artists could potentially use it to determine the style of songs to write and when to come out with those songs for the highest success.  Factors to study could include Day of the Week, Time of Year (Season), Spotify Song Features, & Artist # of Followers. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.  What is the data you will be using? Include data source, size of dataset, main features to be used. Summarize the statistics of your data.** <br>\n",
    "The data we will be using is Spotify data from 2017 to 2020 from 2 sources on Kaggle:\n",
    "\n",
    "Spotify Charts: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/spotify-charts \n",
    "Spotify Artists/Tracks: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-600k-tracks?select=tracks.csv \n",
    "\n",
    "Three Primary Data Sets from these sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "artists.csv: 1162095 rows, Main Features to be used --> artist name, popularity, and number of followers.  We'd use this file to merge the Artist # of Followers onto the Song Dataset using Artist name to add that metric to our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "charts.csv: 26173514 rows. Main Features to be used --> Date, # of Streams on Top 200, Chart Rank, Time on Chart.  We'd use this file to label the success of each song we study.  \n",
    "\n",
    "tracks.csv: 586672 rows. this has information that Spotify generated, characterizing various songs with continuous data (loudness, energy, danceability), as well as some discrete data (key, time_signature). To make this data easier to use in our models, we will apply Standardization to all of the continuous parameters.  For the discrete data we will create one-hot encodings.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.  What prediction algorithms do you plan to use? Please describe them in detail.** <br>\n",
    "We plan to try a mix of classification & regression models to approach this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will use a Feedforward Neural Network to predict whether any song coming out between 2017 and 2021 will land on the top 200.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we will use the data that does hit the top 200 and predict using linear regression & gradient descent how many streams a given song will have while on the top 200.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will give the artist a way to predict not only what features it takes to get on the chart, but also how to stay on the chart and reach a platinum record status.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our baseline models we will use just use the Artist # of Followers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Artist # of Followers\n",
    "\n",
    "For our full models we will use the Artist # of Followers along w/ time features along and the Spotify Song Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Artist # of Followers\n",
    "- Date of Release\n",
    "- Day of Week of Release\n",
    "- Time of Year (Season) of Release\n",
    "- *12 Song Features:* Duration, Danceability, Energy, Loudness, Key, Speechiness, Acoustiness, Instrumentalness, Liveness, Valence, Tempo, Time Signature\n",
    "\n",
    "Since some of our data is time-based, we plan to perform a non-random split between train and test sets in order to make sure our model is predictive of new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The success metrics we will be predicting for the two models will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Binary Classification --> Top 200 or not?\n",
    "2. Regression --> # of Streams on Top 200 Charts within X weeks/months of release\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. How will you evaluate your results? Please describe your chosen performance metrices and/or statistical tests in detail.** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate our first Model (Classification using a Feed-Forward Nueral Network) we will use the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loss, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Sensitivity, Specificity, F1 Score\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to test out different combinations of layers in our neural net (using Keras/Tensorflow) to optimize accuracy on the test dataset.  We'll also assess the other metrics that are typically assessed when evaluating a classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate our second Model (Linear Regression) we will use the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean Squared Error, R Squared\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to use Keras/Tensorflow and run the model at different learning rates to find the optimal mean squared error.\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to make comparisons of our baseline model vs. our optimized model for each of the 4 seasons to see if the additional features from the song & time of year make the model more predictive than just using the artist # of followers alone. <br>"
